# 👋 Hello, I'm Adam

Developer, digital strategist, and neurodivergent advocate based in Northern Ireland. I build tools that solve real problems — for clients, communities, and causes I care about.

## 🧭 What I Do

- 💻 Software development across web, infrastructure, and automation  
- 🧩 Accessibility, open data, and digital rights are recurring themes  
- 🔧 Freelance projects, open source contributions, and the occasional side quest  
- 🧠 Always poking at the edge of what’s possible (or at least, practical)

## 🔧 Languages & Tools

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML, CSS — I speak whatever the problem requires
- **Cloud & Infra**: Hetzner, DigitalOcean, AWS, Cloudflare
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, CapRover

## 🧪 Currently Exploring

- AI tooling, RAG pipelines, and writing custom MCP servers  
- Cyberfeminism and its implications for accessibility and tech governance  
- Experimental ideas like browser-level accessibility APIs and AI-driven accessibility middleware
